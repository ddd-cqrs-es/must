  /// the parallel processing. Instead, each object can live in its own thread
  /// and no other thread should ever touch it(that's why mutexes are not
  /// needed). Other threads can comunnicate with the object by sendind it
  /// messages(T). Same way the object can speak to other objects - potentially
  /// running in different threads - by sending them messages.

  /// The mailbox message processing is single threaded and no more than one
  /// task will be active at any given time. When a message is
  /// send to it, it is queued to be processed by the executor. The
  /// executor runs until the message queue is empty. So, if you are using
